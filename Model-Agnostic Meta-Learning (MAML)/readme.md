# Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning | Prof. Rohit Budhiraja

Project Goal: To develop a Few-Shot / Meta-Learning-based training algorithm that enables fast and efficient domain adaptation using very limited training samples. The project targets modern wireless applications (mmWave, UAV, IoT) to allow rapid adaptation to new environments for tasks such as channel reconstruction, localization, and mobility prediction.

Mentors: Vashi Diwakar, Hrushikesh Roop Avvari & Chaitanya Nitawe

All weekly resources, papers, and code implementations will be uploaded here.
