This is a fairly reasonable solution, and we use it to normalize the neural network's input. Now imagine the goal is to normalize some intermediate values in a deep neural network; Collecting values of some intermediate point in a neural network is almost impossible since the training algorithm can change them entirely. To overcome this issue, we can collect them over a mini-batch.  It will give us an estimated version of the mean and variance. This is why it is called Batch Normalization.
